## My process

I started to plan the HTML structure. I have wavered between flexbox and grid for a moment and decided to go with flex. After the bone structure I thought about the helper classes for the headings, text, images and divs. The mobile version was created first and later the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Its pretty tough to nail down a pixel perfect version without the design specifics from Figma and so on. I think in the future I would go on the Pro version, so that I can compare better the build version with the designed once.
